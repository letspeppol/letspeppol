We are still in the launching phase.
This repo will contain all the code involved in running the Let's Peppol project:
* a [docs](./docs/) folder with the website that runs on GitHub Pages at https://letspeppol.org
* a [proxy](./proxy/) folder with the API proxy that runs on Heroku at https://api.letspeppol.org
* a `kyc` folder that will contain the Know-Your-Customer component (initially only for Belgian VAT numbers)
* an `app` folder that will contain our web interface
