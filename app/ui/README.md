This project is bootstrapped by [aurelia 2](https://github.com/aurelia/new).  
For more information about `aurelia` visit [aurelia.io](https://aurelia.io) or [docs.aurelia.io](https://docs.aurelia.io).  

Make sure you have the following tools installed:
* Node.js version 22 or higher
* Code editor of your choice
* A https proxy when testing with Web-eID

## Run project
1. Change directory to the project folder using the cli
2. `npm install` to install packages
3. `npm start` to start up a Vite development server running on port `9000`

* `npm run test` to run unit tests
* `npm run test:watch` to run unit tests in watch mode

## Nix development environment

A `devenv` environment is available in the `dev/ui` directory. Make sure you have [`devenv`](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/) installed, and optionally install [`direnv`](https://devenv.sh/automatic-shell-activation/) for automatic shell activation. If you don’t use `direnv`, you’ll need to run `devenv shell` manually from the `dev/ui` directory. When working in this environment, add the `--prefix ../../ui` option to commands like `npm install` so they target the actual project directory.
